# Stamina Challenge 

I learned about html, css, and js in the year 2019. At the time my professor told gave us a task to create a game from his template. I made this game where the task is to simply click the green dot the amount of times stated before the timer ran out. Due to the lack of knowledge, I had glaring issues that I want to fix up with my current (year 2022) knowledge.

## Issues
* Internal Timer was out of sync
* The game had no theme
* Game board randomization was out of sync
* Garbage code which doesn't help with efficiency
* I want to add something database related

## Mission
My mission is to fix these issues and create a secondary readme with the newer documentation.

When completed it will be found.... here.

Below is information on the original project.

**turquoise**: Subtracts a level. (Apparenlty he is the king of this dimension and the main villan."But thats just a theory. A ..."  There is always a place for plot and lore.) [Line found in the documentation from Matthew of 2019]
